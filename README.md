# Kindergarten Management System

This application can potentially make it easier for kindergarten principals to manage students details and a place where the teachers and students can share study materials. This application is being developed using Spring Boot for the backend, JWT for the authentication, ReactJS for the frontend and MySQL & Firebase for the database.
